This directory contains 4 subdirectories:
- The In-Domain directory contains the accuracy metrics (in Evaluation data.txt) and predicted charts for five models applied by our ranking classifier in the in-domain experiments. For these experiments, the classifier trained on charts including artists in the domain specified by Artists.csv (in Data directory), and tested on a chart which only included artists in the same domain. Produced decision tree also provided.
- The Out-of-Domain directory contains the accuracy metrics (in Evaluation data.txt) and predicted charts for five models applied by our ranking classifier in the out-of-domain experiments. For these experiments, the classifier trained on charts including artists in the domain specified by Artists.csv (in Data directory), but tested on a chart which possibly include unknown, untracked artists. Produced decision tree also provided.
- The Sentiment directory contains the accuracy metrics (in Evaluation data.txt) and predicted chart for the sentiment analysis experiment. Also includes the sentiment scores produced for each artist.
