# Using Twitter to Rank Musical Artist Popularity

This repository served as the workspace for our project on Billboard Artist 100 Ranking Predictions. The final paper explaining the methods and results for this project can be found [here](https://pdfhost.io/v/MGPL39NG1_Proceedings_Template_WORD.pdf).

The Code-Data-Results folder houses the final code along with documentation.


Note: Billboard API from @guoguo12, and Next Big Sound API Python wrapper from @buckhx.
